# informed-exploration-via-next-state-prediction

`old_src` covers the infrastructure we wrote for the Deep Q Learning agents during the initial stages of our work.
Due do the computational expensive nature of training DQN agents, we switched to Q-Learning based agents.

The code for our imagination and prediction pipelines may be found in `src`.
